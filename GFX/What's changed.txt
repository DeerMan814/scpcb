Item Names:
all of them basically renamed, also:
-paperstrips is never used
-vest uses a texture from the NPCs folder, consider moving it to items instead
-the world model for paper-based objects should just be the paper itself
-doc914 was never used so I removed it
-why the fuck was there a doc109
-need to figure out what all the loose metal textures are for
